# Bass-App
A modern, responsive website for a music app.

This is my favorite project so far.  why?  Because it's the first one that I've developed from scratch (for the most part).
It was a website project from CodeCademy's "Make A Website Projects".  However, the lesson gave only a few instructions on some
essential content to include, leaving the project far from being finished (a bug in their program?).  So the rest was up to me.  
I really enjoyed this project, and I believe I learned a lot through it.  What's more, it's a spitting image of the original, 
aside from a few personal changes that I made, so I must be doing something right.  Of course, it comes down to the efficiency 
and cleanness of the code, which I know isn't perfect, but I'm getting there.
